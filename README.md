# Grow

Welcome to Grow, a platform designed to connect producers, farmers, and consumers to reduce food miles, increase sustainability, and reduce pollution. Our project leverages a modern tech stack to achieve these goals, including React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and a basic machine learning model for voice recognition. We've also integrated Stripe for secure and seamless payment processing.
